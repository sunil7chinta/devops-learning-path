## About This Repo

- Documents my shift from backend development to DevOps and production engineering
- Built to understand how software is **deployed, scaled, monitored, and operated** in real environments
- Focused on **hands-on learning**, not theory — everything here comes from experiments and real outcomes

## Why I Started

- Writing APIs is only one part of building software
- Production systems need reliability, automation, and operational discipline
- Learning infrastructure + operations helps engineers build stronger systems end-to-end

## What You’ll Find Here

- Infrastructure setup and environment basics
- Deployment workflows and release practices
- Automation scripts and repeatable setups
- Monitoring/observability and operational notes
- Learnings, mistakes, and improvements captured as I go

## Mindset Shift

- From: **“Does it work on my machine?”**
- To: **“Will it survive in production?”**
